    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizes the analysis\n",
    "The analysis of School data and Student data shows that 15 total schools, with 39,170 students, varies greatly in terms of school budget and therefore per student budget. The top schools are all charter schools and the bottom schools (in terms of % overall passing) are district schools. There is not much difference in either direction when looking at reading and math scores from the 9th graders, to 12th graders. The level of comprehension that the student enters high school with, is most likely what they will graduate with. Spending ranges also does not heavily correlate to higher math or reading scores, math scores actually drop the higher the spending range is per student. And reading scores only drop about 2 points between the lowest and highest range of spending per student. The worst overall passing score is seen at the highest range of spending per student, so this shows that more money per student does not mean the student is getting a higher level of care. \n",
    "\n",
    "Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations\n",
    "The correlation between the top schools and the bottom schools has more to do with the total student count, compared to the per student budget. This means that the amount of students at the school has a far greater impact on the amount of students passing overall, then how much the school has to spend on each student. This most likely means there are more students getting lost per classroom in the larger district schools, compared to the charter schools with less students. The math scores have the largest gap between the bottom and top performing schools. The bottom schools have averages sitting around 77 and 76, while the top schools have average math scores at 83. When you take a look at math scores by grade, there is not much difference as 9th graders compared to 12th graders. This most likely means that the level the student enters high school as, they will graduate at that same level in terms of math comprehension. The low math scores at the district schools compared to the charter schools (looking at math scores by grade) could mean that the students filtering into the district schools came from less advantaged middle schools. Compared to the students from the charter schools most likely coming from more advantaged middle schools and even elementary schools.  \n",
